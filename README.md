# Spatial updating is the cognitive process that allows individuals keep track of object locations in a space during self-motion or orientation change \\cite{TsengEtAl}.

# Virtual Reality (VR), as a dual-environment paradigm, enables overlapping physical and virtual spaces \\cite{liftonDualRealityMerging2010} \\cite{TsengEtAl}.

# In a previous study, \\textcite{TsengEtAl} investigated the gap how spatial updating performance in dual environments is related to the sense of presence in VR by manipulating self-rotation. 

# Participants encoded the location of target pairs in both the virtual and physical environments.\\\\

# However, limitations of their study design include the implementation of rotation tasks and that it does not account for diverse rotation techniques, such as \\emph{Snap Rotation}, as a discrete and incremental reorientation via joystick commonly used in VR applications.

# To address these limitations I optimized the previous study design by aligning trial orientations (refining the rotation) and introducing a \\emph{Snap Rotation} condition. \\\\\\\\

# A preliminary study ($N=6$) was conducted to explore how self-rotation (rotate vs. static), encoded environment (virtual vs. physical) and rotation method (\\emph{Snap Rotation} vs. \\emph{Full-Body Rotation}) affect spatial updating performance in dual environments using VR.

# Optimizing the rotation tasks did not reveal statistically significant core findings - likely due to the small sample size - not validating and not failing \\textcite{TsengEtAl}'s study. 

# The inclusion of \\emph{Snap Rotation} resulted in increasing reaction times and decreasing pointing accuracy, especially during rotate trials.\\\\

# This refined experimental framework incorporates \\emph{Snap Rotation} and is intended to be reused and adapted by future researchers investigating spatial updating in dual environments.
