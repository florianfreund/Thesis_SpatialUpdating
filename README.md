Abstract:
Spatial updating is the cognitive process that allows individuals keep track of object locations in a space during self-motion or orientation change [Riecke2007Spatial].
Virtual Reality (VR), as a dual-environment paradigm, enables overlapping physical and virtual spaces [liftonDualRealityMerging2010, TsengEtAl].
In a previous study, the gap was investigated how spatial updating performance in dual environments is related to the sense of presence in VR by manipulating self-rotation [TsengEtAl]. 
However, limitations of their study design include the implementation of rotation tasks and that it does not account for diverse rotation techniques, such as Snap Rotation, as a discrete and incremental reorientation via joystick commonly used in VR applications.
To address these limitations I optimized the previous study design by aligning trial orientations (refining the rotation) and introducing a Snap Rotation condition. 
A preliminary study (N=6) was conducted to explore how self-rotation (rotate vs. static), encoded environment (virtual vs. physical) and rotation method (Snap Rotation vs. Full-Body Rotation) affect spatial updating performance in dual environments using VR.
Optimizing the rotation tasks did not reveal statistically significant core findings - likely due to the small sample size - not validating and not failing the previous study. 
The inclusion of Snap Rotation resulted in increasing reaction times and decreasing pointing accuracy, especially during rotate trials.
This refined experimental framework incorporates Snap Rotation and is intended to be reused and adapted by future researchers investigating spatial updating in dual environments.
